# aaronstoolkit
This is a toolkit filled with all of my latest projects including the following: 

1. Metasploit
  * Creating an Andoid apk
  * Embedding that apk
  * Exploiting the apk
2. DNS Spoofing
3. Slowloris
4. Cracking WiFi networks

This framework should run under most verions of Linux but is optimized for working on Kali.
The setup is very straight-forward just copy and paste the following code into a terminal:
```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AaronVigal/aaronstoolkit/master/setup&&sudo chmod +x setup&&sudo ./setup 
```
The setup file installs the following dependencies:

1. Metasplot framework
2. aircrack-ng
3. the other stuff I havn't completed yet
